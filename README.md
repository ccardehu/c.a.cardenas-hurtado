# Bio

I am currently an LSE Fellow in the Department of Statistics at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). I obtained a PhD in Statistics (Social Statistics) from the LSE, working under supervision of Professor [Irini Moustaki](https://irmoustaki.github.io/) and Dr. [Yunxiao Chen](https://stats.lse.ac.uk/cheny185/).

My research focuses on methodological and computational developments of latent variable models, with applications in the social and behavioural sciences. From a technical perspective, my work ties elements from stochastic and high-dimensional constrained optimisation, stochastic-approximation and regularisation techniques in marginal maximum likelihood estimation problems, distributional regression models, and semi-parametric regression models.

Before transitioning into academia, I was an Economist at Banco de la República (Colombian Central Bank), working on macroeconomic analysis and forecasting.
