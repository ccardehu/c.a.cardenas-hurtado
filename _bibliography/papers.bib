  abstract    = {Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are restricted latent class models widely used for measuring attributes of interest in diagnostic assessments in education, psychology, biomedical sciences, and related fields. Partial-mastery CDMs (PM-CDMs) are an important extension of CDMs. They model individuals' status for each attribute to be continuous for measuring the partial mastery level, which relaxes the restrictive discrete-attribute assumption of classical CDMs. As a result, PM-CDMs often yield better fits for real-world data and refined measurement of the substantive attributes of interest. However, these models inherit some strong parametric assumptions from the traditional CDMs about the item response functions and, thus, still suffer from a significant risk of model misspecification. This paper proposes a generalized additive PM-CDM (GaPM-CDM) that substantially relaxes the parametric assumptions of PM-CDMs. This proposal leverages model parsimony and interpretability by modeling each item response function as a mixture of nonparametric monotone functions of attributes. A method for the estimation of GaPM-CDM is developed, which combines the marginal maximum likelihood estimator with a sieve approximation of the nonparametric functions. The new model is applicable under both confirmatory and exploratory settings, depending on whether prior knowledge is available about the relationship between observed variables and attributes. The proposed method is applied to two measurement problems from educational testing and healthcare research, respectively, and further evaluated and compared with PM-CDMs through extensive simulation studies.},

  abstract    = {We introduce a general framework for latent variable modeling, named Generalized Latent Variable Models for Location, Scale, and Shape parameters (GLVM-LSS). This framework extends the generalized linear latent variable model beyond the exponential family distributional assumption and enables the modeling of distributional parameters other than the mean (location parameter), such as scale and shape parameters, as functions of latent variables. Model parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood. We present two real-world applications on public opinion research and educational testing, and evaluate the model’s performance in terms of parameter recovery through extensive simulation studies. Our results suggest that the GLVM-LSS is a valuable tool in applications where modeling higher-order moments of the observed variables through latent variables is of substantive interest. The proposed model is implemented in the R package glvmlss, available online.},

Using cross-sectional data for 23 metropolitan areas, we apply an extension of a principal axes method—Multiple Factor Analysis for Multiple Contingency Tables  (MFACT)—in  order  to  identify  unobservable  factors  that  are  relevant when  disentangling  the  heterogeneity  observed  among  groups  of  variables considered explanatory of regional unemployment differentials.

  abstract    = {The consumer confidence index (CCI) is very relevant for economic analysis due to its timely publication and forecasting capacities. Although there is extensive literature on the link between CCI and macroeconomic aggregates, in particular with households' consumption, few papers have studied the fundamental factors that explain the CCI behaviour. Actually, no attempt has been made for the Colombian case. In this paper we aim to fill this gap. We estimate a Structural Factor-Augmented VAR (SFAVAR) model and perform a historical decomposition (HD) on the CCI series to obtain the underlying structural innovations that drove the CCI dynamics over the past few years. Our findings suggest that the CCI responded to changes in the underlying determinants and to non-fundamental shocks possibly related to uncertainty periods and noneconomic, socio-political or electoral events. Moreover, a counterfactual analysis shows that households' consumption forecasts improve when using the CCI series that are not affected by these non-fundamental shocks.},

  abstract    = {Terms of trade (ToT) shocks drive business cycles and have direct impact on the macroeconomic equilibrium conditions in commodity-exporter countries. ToT shocks also affect the dynamics of other variables such as national income and relative prices, and consequently, cause agents and firms to adjust their saving, spending and investment decisions accordingly. The latter is of special interest because of its link with potential GDP and the capital stock of the economy, relevant concepts when assessing sustainable and long-run growth. In this document we explore how tradable and nontradable investment rates respond asymmetrically to ToT shocks. We estimate a Threshold VAR (TVAR) in which the ToT are the transition variable. The empirical results suggest the existence of two regimes (low and high ToT levels) and that ToT shocks have different effects on tradable and nontradable investment rates depending not only the direction of the shock, but also on the levels from which the shock departs.},
